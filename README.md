# Drafting Dynamically

This is a set of tools for quickly being able to follow drafting patterns, especially patterns from 'The "Keystone" jacket and dress cutter'.

This book from 1895 is full of excellent information about some basic tailored garments of the period. While the book is freely available online, it is also kind of difficult to follow at times. 
The old-fashioned language, out-of-order steps, and odd labeling choices make the process somewhat hard to follow. 

So, I'm putting together this toolset to help you follow the drafting instructions more easily, and even be able to print out the nearly-finished pattern if you like. The steps are nearly the same as in the book, just reworded and re-ordered for clarity.
I have also added a few steps here and there from other chapters in the book to help clarify some of the points that didn't make much sense.

I am hoping in the future to have more of the patterns made available in this way, and perhaps even some designs of my own. Let me know what you think, and if you find this at all useful!

The Patterns folder contains .js files for each pattern prepared to be used in this program. Each file contains all the information needed for that pattern, including the source, designer, steps, points, and needed measurements.
